Statistical analysis of state-level data shows that immigrants expand the economyâ€™s productive capacity by stimulating investment and promoting specialization. This produces efficiency gains and boosts income per worker. At the same time, evidence is scant that immigrants diminish the employment opportunities of U.S.-born workers.</p>
